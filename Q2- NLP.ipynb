It draws on the concepts of the BCG AI \\nIceberg and academic literature, which assert that a  \\nsuccessful implementation of AI is one that impacts  \\nthe revenues, margins and sustainability of the business. \\nAmong the key contributors of organizational success \\nfrom AI adoption, algorithms drive approximately 10%  \\nof the success, while data and technology infrastructure \\nadds a further 20%. The remaining 70% hinges on people, \\nprocesses and business transformation.\\nThis study particularly draws on the views of Chief Data \\nOfficers (CDO), Chief Analytics Officers (CAO), Chief Tech-\\nnology Officers (CTO) and Chief Digital Transformation \\nOfficers from leading organizations across the BFSI, CG \\nand IG sectors. It also draws on interviews with Business \\nUnit heads to gauge their views on the impact of AI on \\nbusiness outcomes. The result is a detailed, calibrated \\nunderstanding of a) these organizations’ plans with respect \\nto AI; b) the investments and measures taken to operation-\\nalize those plans; c) the changes underway across technol-\\nogy, organization, people and procedures; and d) the  \\nobserved outcome.\\nThe study reveals that select Indian BFSI companies  \\n(particularly banks and new-age NBFCs) have very high AI \\nMaturity, on par with global frontrunners. We have divided \\ncompanies into four groups based on their maturity level—\\nLeaders, Steady Followers, Leapfroggers and Laggards. 11% \\nof companies in the set were adjudged Leaders. Their lead-\\nership position is facing a stiff challenge from the Leapfrog -\\ngers, who make up 9% of the companies. Leapfroggers \\nstarted their AI-driven transformation journey late but  \\nhave improved sharply in AI Maturity in the last three years, \\nconverging with the Leaders on most aspects of AI Maturity. \\nHowever, the concern is that 2/3rds of the companies in \\nthe set remain Laggards. These are companies with some \\nexposure and investment in AI in their Technology, Data \\nand Analytical capabilities. But AI is not a strategic priority \\nfor them. Three out of four companies in Consumer Goods \\nand Industrial Goods are Laggards by this assessment.  \\nJust 5% of IG and CG organizations surveyed are AI Maturi-\\nty leaders. The AI laggardness could have severe implica-\\ntions for the competitiveness of Indian manufacturing if it \\nremains unaddressed. For legacy companies, size and scale alone offers little \\nprotection against deft small competitors who are master -\\ning AI usage. We are seeing a rapid rise in mid- and small-\\nsize players (as many as 16% of the companies studied) \\nwhich are well-positioned to capture greater market share. \\nUnencumbered by legacy issues, they have thrown down \\nthe gauntlet, not only to larger more established players  \\nin their industry but also to AI maturity Leaders.\\nLeaders and Leapfroggers tend to adopt a ‘use case-first’ \\napproach to AI adoption. They take time to identify use \\ncases which will have a palpable impact on the balance \\nsheet. They then deploy technology, people and processes  \\nto support those use cases. Laggards, on the other hand, \\ntake a technology-first approach. They often end up with \\nwhite elephant technologies which have limited impact on \\nbusiness outcomes. Steady Followers lie in between these \\ntwo groups. They tend to choose use cases that are tentative \\nand small-scale, and thus rarely transform the organization \\nto the extent required to let AI play out at scale.\\nThe country’s ecosystem plays a vital role in this endeavor, \\nas both a supplier and enabler of essential talent. If the \\ntop 500 listed companies in India made AI a strategic prior -\\nity, they would need at least 25,000 to 30,000  advanced \\npractitioners of AI-ML in the next 3-5 years. This covers  \\nthe entire gamut of AI professionals, from data scientists \\nand data engineers to enterprise architects. But it does  \\nnot include managerial and leadership talent, nor the \\nworkforce in AI vendor ecosystems and support infrastruc-\\nture which must enable these AI initiatives. Even with \\nIndia’s engineering and science talent, the quest for higher \\nAI Maturity requires significant training and upskilling \\nacross data engineering, enterprise architecture, product \\nmanagement, design thinking, domain knowledge, Agile \\nworking and management of digital organizations. Finding \\nand training talent in requisite numbers will be a critical \\ndeterminant of whether India gains competitiveness in AI.\\nResearch shows that AI investments augmenting end-user \\nvalue and topline growth could drive significant economic \\nand wage expansion.

The last three decades have seen specialized \\nusage of increasing intensity. Today, its potential applications \\ncover every area of human activity, and no company can \\nafford to ignore it. We have identified five factors that explain \\nthe increasing pervasiveness of AI in recent decades.\\nThe democratization of AI: Originally funded for military \\npurposes, AI was subsequently nurtured in research labs \\nand universities. Since the early 2000s, it has increasingly \\nbeen deployed in industrial and real-world applications. \\nBut till as recently as the last decade, AI implementation \\nand adoption was limited to organizations with advanced \\nresources, high investment in data infrastructure and expensive computational setups. This period may be \\ncalled the Pre-Democratization era of AI (PD-AI). \\nSince then, three factors have lowered the entry barriers \\nin AI adoption. Firstly, rapid fall in cost of data storage and \\ncomputational power. Secondly, cost effective cloud-based \\ndata and computational architecture which converts high \\nupfront technology CapEx to more manageable and \\nscalable OpEx. Lastly, coding platforms with low code or \\nno code environment allowing companies to get started \\non basic AI use-cases. The last 5-7 years have thus been \\na period of Democratization of AI (D-AI).

However, companies are \\nstruggling to find AI talent with the requisite business \\nand sector understanding. As a result, direct hire of AI \\ntalent remains low despite high demand. A NASSCOM \\nreport6 also projects that the demand-supply gap for dig -\\nital technology talent will grow 3.5x+ by 2026 to 1.4-1.8 \\nmillion. The current study estimates that core AI talent- \\ndata scientist, data engineer, enterprise architect would \\nbe 15% to 20% of the headline number. Further just the \\ntop 500 corporates (listed corporates by revenue) would \\nneed at least 25,000 to 30,000  advanced practitioners of \\nAIML in the next 3-5 years. To handle AI driven transfor -\\nmations, the existing senior and middle managements \\nof these 500 companies would require a minimum a \\nmillion hours of training!• R&D and Intellectual Property: While India ranks \\nin the global top 10 for AI research and patents, the \\nassociated value being captured is relatively miniscule. \\nThe pay-off in terms of patents, products and profits \\nremains low relative to the volume of research conduct-\\ned. The reasons for this are manifold. Research in latest \\ntechnologies is often limited to incrementalism in most \\nfirms. Additionally, a fledgling collaboration between \\nindustry-academia limits monetizable research and IP \\ncreation. This scenario further discourages advanced tal-\\nent development. Currently, less than 3% of graduates \\npursue a PhD in the field.\\n• Investments in AI: The last decade has seen a rapid \\nuptick in the number of Indian startups. Indian orga-\\nnizations have also accelerated their adoption of da-\\nta-driven use cases.

Approximately 10% of this success can  \\nbe attributed to algorithms, and another 20% may be \\nattributed to enabling data and technology capability.  \\nBut the bulk of the success, that is 70%, hinges on \\npeople, processes and business transformation.\\nThis means that simply acquiring technology or using the \\nlatest Machine Learning tools would not confer a strategic \\nbenefit by itself.

But this will not transform the loan \\nacquisition and underwriting process if the model scores \\nare regularly overwritten by subjective judgment and \\nineffective credit policies.\\nSuch an implementation of the risk model may offer \\nlimited benefits to the organization. However, large-scale benefits will accrue only through fundamental changes \\nto the policy, operating processes, and behavior of the \\nentire loan origination setup to enable digital workflow \\nand data driven decision making. In the absence of such \\ntransformations, even organizations with a bespoke \\nAI model will be deemed to have low AI Maturity.\\nOn the other hand, consider a Consumer Goods company \\nthat has begun to embrace AI by adopting a reasonable \\n(though not cutting-edge) demand forecasting model for \\nits products.

It also delves into the action being taken \\nto realize the ambition, including specific plans and \\nexecution minutiae to achieve the target end-state. Fur -\\nther, this dimension also considers the extent to which \\nleaders are trying to change their culture to focus more \\non data analytics-driven decision-making vis-a-vis purely \\nsubjective decision making.\\n2. Use Case: This dimension deals with the specific \\nbusiness problems that AI can potentially solve \\nfor the organization. The survey assesses the level of \\nawareness about AI use cases across functions and busi-\\nness units. It also examines the organization’s approach \\nto prioritizing use cases at the outset. The scale and \\nscope of these use cases is the de facto measure of an \\norganization’s AI ambitions. The extent to which pro -cesses and people strategies are transformed to ensure \\nthe success of the use case will determine the success  \\nof the AI transformation initiative.\\n3.

With regard to analytics, it looks at the  \\nextent of usage of analytics—descriptive, predictive  \\nand prescriptive—as well as the assurance, quality  \\nand sophistication of the analytical process itself.\\n6. Change Management and Value: Firstly this di-\\nmension delves into the processes and approaches \\nused to ensure the adoption and acceptance of AI \\noutput into decision-making.

It also looks at the level of \\ntraining required to prepare and sensitize large organiza-\\ntions to AI, and the typical steps taken to transform each \\nfunction.\\n7. Technology: This dimension examines the IT and \\npeople capability used to support AI development \\nand implementation. This deals with the organiza-\\ntion’s data architecture, its computational infrastructure \\nand its flexibility to develop, deploy and maintain AI.\\nThe survey covers seven dimensions, with 27 questions \\ndelving into 130 aspects of AI Maturity. During the inter -\\nviews, leaders were invited to classify the behavior of their \\nrespective organizations with respect to each dimension of \\nthe survey. They were probed on how their AI aspirations, \\nplanning and behavior evolved across three points in time \\nthree years before, i.e. pre-COVID, the current level, and \\nthe target level (three years hence). The behaviors were \\npre-mapped to the maturity levels and subsequently \\nmapped to the overall maturity of the organization.\\nThe wider purpose of the exercise is to benchmark Indian \\ncompanies with respect to AI Maturity and prepare them \\nto compete globally in an era of AI. As such, the dimen-\\nsion-wise maturity thresholds are comparable to global \\nbenchmarks. We found that companies identified as  \\n‘Leaders’ currently have an average maturity score of 3.9. \\nOf these, the subset of companies with a score above 4  \\nare globally comparable in terms of their AI Maturity.  \\nThis includes several financial institutions and few players \\nin the industrial and manufacturing space. On the other \\nhand, a maturity level of 3 is an absolute threshold, i.e. \\ncompanies with an overall maturity level below 3 need not \\nbe considered as serious players who could gain any mean-\\ningful benefit from AI.\\nTo recap, companies with a maturity score over 4 are  \\ncomparable globally in terms of AI Maturity, while those with a score below 3 lack a meaningful plan or on-ground \\naction to enhance their business decision-making and \\noverall functioning by integrating AI. The latter companies \\nare likely to struggle with market share and margin im-\\nprovement even in the short to medium term, unless they \\nget back on the AI track.\\nClassifying companies by maturity level\\nThe aggregated score from each dimension determines the \\nmaturity level of the company during that period. Based on \\ntheir current maturity levels, the surveyed companies have \\nbeen divided into four groups:\\n• Leaders: This is the top 10% of the set, characterized \\nby consistently high maturity levels across all dimen-\\nsions in the current period. Even though the maturity \\nlevel is based on the current period, we found that these \\ncompanies were leading the pack across dimensions in \\nthe pre-COVID period too.\\n• Aspiring Leaders (Steady Followers and Leapfrog -\\ngers): Close on the heels of the Leaders are these two \\nsets of companies, whose current maturity scores are \\nvery similar. What differentiates them is the path they \\nhave followed to reach the current maturity level. Steady \\nFollowers will have had a constant gap to Leaders across \\ndifferent points in time. On the other hand, Leapfroggers \\nhad almost the same level of maturity as Laggards in the \\npre-COVID period. However, they have made significant \\nprogress over the last three years and now rub shoulders \\nwith the Steady Followers, and may even have higher \\nmaturity scores than them in some dimensions.\\n• Laggards: These are companies whose current aggre-\\ngated maturity level is well below 3—the threshold for \\na company to be considered as seriously pursuing AI in \\nterms of strategy, planning and on-ground execution.\\nUnderstanding movement across maturity levels\\nEven making the jump from Management Information \\nSystems (MIS) to descriptive analysis and then to predic-\\ntive requires enablers such as data quality, technology \\ninfrastructure and analytics acumen. But this journey \\nrequires a certain maturity and evolution in senior man-\\nagement ambition on how to drive the business. It also \\nrequires a commitment to embed data and analytics in \\ndecision-making at various levels, from transactional to \\ntactical and eventually strategic. In turn, this requires \\nsuitable processes and an organizational setup to generate \\nhigh-quality analytical outputs and to ensure that the \\nbusiness actively uses them.', metadata={'source': 'ai-in-india.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

During \\ndeep-dives, we found that the problem wasn’t so much  \\nthe technology or algorithm chosen, but the sub-optimal \\nadoption of the AI output in business processes. Such \\ncompanies often find it difficult to create and measure \\nvalue from their AI initiatives. As Exhibit 13 shows,  \\nTechnology and Data & Algorithms are relatively minor \\nconstituents of overall AI success. The biggest factors  \\nare people, operations and practices to enable AI-driven \\ntransformation.\\nAI Maturity and operating performance\\nOn average, total shareholder returns (TSR) over a 5-year \\nperiod are 4-6 times higher for Leaders than for other \\nmaturity groups. Meanwhile, Laggards have the lowest \\nTSR across industry classes. AI Maturity is just one of \\nthe reasons for superior TSR.

Our re-\\nsearch has identified several promising ways to win with AI:\\n• Integrate AI strategy with business strategy: AI \\nleaders look backwards from strategy, not forward from \\nAI. They ask, “what are our business objectives—and \\nhow can AI help us meet them?” Companies that ap -\\nproach AI in this way are more likely to take it beyond \\nautomation and cost savings—and take the impact of  \\nAI further, too.\\n• Take on large projects with big impact: Our analysis \\nreveals that companies do better with AI if they place \\ncarefully calculated bets. Of the companies that invest \\nin higher-risk AI projects, 50% have seen value to date. \\nAmong those that invest primarily in low-risk projects, \\njust 23% have seen gains. Tellingly, the willingness to \\ntake risks appears to increase with an organization’s \\nAI Maturity level. Quick wins can also bring an added \\nbonus. By validating AI’s ability to spark value, they \\ncan keep the momentum—and the funding—going for \\nlonger-term projects.\\n• Align the production of AI with the consumption \\nof AI: Getting the most out of AI requires a team ef -\\nfort. A good rule of thumb is to consider AI to be 10% \\nabout algorithms, 20% about technology and 70% about \\nbusiness process transformation. Companies that focus \\nsolely on the production of AI—leveraging data, technol-\\nogy, and tools to build solutions—are less likely to derive \\nvalue than those that enable the consumption or usage \\nof AI. The idea is to bring together the technical side and \\nthe business side so that both can better understand \\nwhat solutions are needed, what solutions are possible, \\nand how to build for usability as well as functionality.\\n• Treat AI as a major business transformation effort: \\nAI doesn’t thrive in a vacuum. Companies that generate \\nvalue from AI treat it as a major business transformation \\ninitiative that requires different parts of the company \\nto come together and work as one. For AI to work well, \\ncompanies need to integrate it into their fabric and into the individual processes that power the core of the busi-\\nness. They need to tap into the right data sources, create \\nthe right processes (or reengineer existing ones), and \\ndevelop the right feedback loops, so that AI can keep \\ngetting better. They also need to ensure that the users  \\nof the AI solution are very actively involved in the design \\nof that solution from Day 1.\\nTheme 2: Newer set of teams—introduction of \\nAnalytics Pods/ Squads\\nAs AI@Scale shapes up, several key roles will be needed to \\ndevelop, deploy and sustain AI use cases from a business, \\nchange and technical perspective.

Limited availability of \\nresources and capital has hitherto made it difficult for such \\norganizations to leverage AI at scale. Expensive enterprise \\ntechnology and substantial licensing fees have kept SaaS \\nadoption to a minimum in the MSME sector.21 However,  \\nall that is quickly changing after the pandemic, and IT \\nvendors have become more willing to provide cost-effective \\nand flexible solutions to these enterprises.\\nMSMEs now have access to shared environments and \\nAPI-based micro-services. The use of AI in this sector  \\nhas been accelerated by on-demand access to business \\nsoftware and the availability of services like digital payment \\ngateways, fraud detection systems and CRM. Experts \\nbelieve that mass adoption of SaaS will be the tipping \\npoint for AI usage in India.\\nMany start-ups have also emerged to provide accounting, \\ncustomer management and marketing solutions to \\nMSMEs. Time-consuming manual tasks such as tallying \\naccounts, filing tax returns and GST can now be done  \\nmore efficiently with advanced AI accounting platforms. \\nGiven that these organizations conduct most of their \\nbusiness on credit, their debt collection efforts have also \\nbeen significantly boosted by enhanced risk and predictive \\nanalytics, using AI-based platforms to identify high-risk \\ncredit. Meanwhile, dynamic analytics dashboards are also \\nbeing used to study customer behavior and for inventory \\nand supply chain management.22\\nLarge organizations tend to have multiple layers  \\nof management and slow response times, whereas  \\nthe unique characteristics of small organizations can  \\nhelp them become innovation pioneers and achieve  \\nan experimental edge over larger rivals. Power \\ncentralization (under a single leader), learning orientation \\nand entrepreneurship are some of the factors that \\nresearchers have identified as critical for the adoption  \\nof digital technology.23\\n20. https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1744032\\n21. https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30528/w30528.\\npdf\\n22. https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ER-12-2019-\\n0452/full/pdf?title=automation-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-india\\n23. https://web-assets.bcg.com/89/ee/054f41d848869dd5e4bb86a82e3e/\\nbcg-global-retail-banking-2021-the-front-to-back-digital-retail-bank-\\njan-2021.pdf\\n', metadata={'source': 'ai-in-india.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n",
